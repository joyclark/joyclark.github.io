At [innoQ](https://innoq.com) we have been doing a lot of Open Space events, and we also wanted to be able to moderate them internally. For this reason, we had an internal workshop to plan our Open Space event and to learn how to moderate Open Space events in general. Our trainer was [Martin Heider](https://twitter.com/martinheider), and I learned a lot about Open Space. Looking forward to moderating and participating in a lot of Open Space events in the future!
