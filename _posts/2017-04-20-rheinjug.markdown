I'm one of the organizers for the [rheinJUG](http://rheinjug.de/), and I think it's a great way to get an overview of a topic without having to look into it too deeply.

This talk was a good example of that. I've never really done anything with JNI or interacting with C libraries from within Java, but I thought the talk was interesting ([Christoph Engelbert](https://twitter.com/noctarius2k) is a great speaker) and I definitely learned a lot.

I also thought that this was a good example of how you can really sketchnote with any material that you want. I completely forgot my sketchnoting stuff, and I ended up borrowing a piece of paper from someone and doing a sketchnote with a ballpoint pen. I think the result is pretty nice and definitely helps me remember what went on in the talk (which, afterall, is the most important reason for sketchnoting).
