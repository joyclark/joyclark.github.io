As a Clojure enthusiast who lives in Düsseldorf, I am of course a frequent visitor at the [Düsseldorf Clojure Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Dusseldorf-Clojure-Meetup/).

During the [ClojureScript and omNext](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Dusseldorf-Clojure-Meetup/events/236725468/) talk that we had the pleasure of listening to, I decided to practice my sketchnoting.

Since I am not really an SPA fan ([ROCA](http://roca-style.org/) all the way!), I am unconvinced that I will ever actually use om-next, but it did make me want to go and check out ClojureScript again and see what you could do with progressive enhancement.
