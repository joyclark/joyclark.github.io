description: A write up of the first INNOQ Technology Day with a few sketchnotes
---

Yesterday, the very first INNOQ Technology Day wrapped up, and I wanted to write up my thoughts and impressions and upload my sketchnotes from the day.
Here is [a more detailed write up](https://www.tilkov.com/post/2020/12/10/the-impossible-conference/) of the same conference from the perspective of the organizers.

I believe this was the first virtual conference that I've attended, and I thought that the organization was very well done.
It was relaxing also to have the conference start at noon, so that I could get a few things done before focusing on the conference for the rest of the day.
The talks were superb, and it try out [SpacialChat](https://spatial.chat/) and get a bit of the "conference" feeling of being able to chat with different people in the same room, even though the conference was virtual.
And since the conference was virtual, without a lot of noise and visual stimuli, I found that I was a lot less wiped out at the end of the day than I would normally be.

This conference was also a new first for me personally:
It was my first time rerecording a talk and then watching the recording live with everyone else AND my first time doing a keynote.
My colleagues [Eberhard Wolff](https://twitter.com/ewolff), Andreas Maier, and I each held
a short 15 minute talk as a part of a joint keynote.

In my part of the keynote I talked a lot about responsive and accessible design (or "responsible design" as I have dubbed it), and referenced [my new microsite on the topic](https://responsibleweb.app/).

Since the talk was prerecorded, I was also able to sketchnote my own talk (another first)! Here is my sketchnote:

The next talk that I watched was incredibly fun to sketchnote.
It was a Meta-Sketchnote, since the topic of the talk was sketchnoting in the IT.
[Lisa Moritz](https://twitter.com/Teapot4181)'s talk was very interactive and taught me a few symbols that I hadn't used before.
She's currently writing a book on the topic and also has started a [website displaying her amazing sketchnotes](https://www.sketchnotes.tech/).

As part of a challenge from Lisa, I also sketched out a new symbol for a screenreader:

I find tech conferences to be a great place to listen to new ideas and hear about technologies that I'm not completely comfortable with,
or that I haven't spent the time to learn about yet.
Service meshes are one of those topics that I haven't had a lot of time to research,
so I found this talk from [Hanna Prinz](https://twitter.com/HannaPrinz) and [Jörg Müller](https://twitter.com/JoergM) to be just what I needed:
I learned which options are currently available,
and I learned which criteria I should use to evaluate the different options if I ever need to make that decision.
More information is available on the [Service Mesh Comparison microsite](https://servicemesh.es/).

The next talk was also one that I decided to go to specifically because it is a bit outside of what I currently am doing in my day-to-day work.
[Larysa Visengeriyeva](https://twitter.com/visenger) gave an overview of machine learning engineering, including the ten practices that build off of each other.
More information is available on the [Machine Learning Operations microsite](https://ml-ops.org/).

My last talk of the day was some live-coding with Idris from [Jan Stępień](https://twitter.com/janstepien).
The sketchnote itself isn't very interesting (it's difficult to sketchnote a talk when live-coding is involved), but the talk was very entertaining.

I did not sketchnote the keynote from [Dylan Beattie](https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie),
since I was more in the mood for relaxing on the couch,
so my last talk of the day was from [Stefan Tilkov](https://twitter.com/stilkov), talking
about how to create a software consultancy that people enjoy working for.
I was interested in hearing what he had to say, especially because I really do enjoy working for [INNOQ](https://www.innoq.com/), and I have to say that I agree that all of the points that he made do indeed make it a pleasant place to work.

All in all, it was an enjoyable conference. The talks should eventually come out on the [INNOQ YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/INNOQtv) (although most of them (including mine) will be in German).
