My colleague [Michael PlÃ¶d](https://twitter.com/bitboss) gives great talks, and I was thrilled to be able to hear him speak at my own [rheinJUG](http://rheinjug.de/).

I also loved his detailed description of context design patterns and how they relate to communication between microservices, so I tried to give that a bit more detail.
