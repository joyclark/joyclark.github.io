At [innoQ](https://innoq.com), we had the opportunity to participate in a facilitation training with trainer [Christine Neidhardt](https://twitter.com/teamfuture17). The topics we covered were quite advanced, and I'm not quite sure how I will be able to directly apply them right now. My favorite takeaway was "Be the facilitator you wish you had". I'm looking forward to being able to do some facilitation in the future.

Here are my sketchnotes:
