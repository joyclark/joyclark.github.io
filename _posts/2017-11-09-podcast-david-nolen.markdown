I had a great time interviewing [David Nolen](https://twitter.com/swannodette) about clojurescript.
I got to ask him a lot of questions about working on a compiler, what Macros are, the benefits of integrating with the Google Closure Compiler. We also had a very interesting discussion concerning how to develop the frontend of web applications.
The interview was released for the [CaSE Podcast](http://www.case-podcast.org/12-clojurescript-with-david-nolen).

I made a sketchnote of the podcast episode.

I also made some of sketchnotes in preparation for the interview.

The first was for David's talk [Id√©e Fixe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzXHMy4ewtM) that he gave at the GOTO Chicago

Then I also did some sketchnote for several different talks that David did on YouTube.
This was more of a brain dump which includes some of the questions I ended up asking and not very structured. But I also like it because it shows that this is a valid format for sketchnotes.
