Easily my favorite workshop this year (although I really do love [innoQ](https://innoq.com) workshops)! We can draw! Our trainer was [Desiree van Dijk](https://twitter.com/desireevdijk) from [Bikablo](http://bikablo.kommunikationslotsen.de/). If you ever get to do a training from them, take advantage of it!

I felt like learning about shadows, containers, and overlapping, and learning some new pictograms, has taken my drawing to a whole new level!
