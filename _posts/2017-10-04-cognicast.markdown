I had the great honor to be a guest on the Cognicast! [Carin Meier](https://twitter.com/gigasquid) was the host for the episode and we got to talk about a few of my favorite things: my brief foray into formal methods, Clojure, web security and web applications. Many many thanks to Cognitect for having me on the show!
