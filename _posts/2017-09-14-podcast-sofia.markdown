I interviewed Sofia Vaughn-Jones (who was Sofia Cole at the time I interviewed her but got married in the 3 weeks between the interview and when it was published). We talked about Scala, how to learn Scala and a little bit about monads.
The interview was released for the [CaSE Podcast](http://www.case-podcast.org/10-scale-with-sofia-vaughn-jones).

I made a sketchnote of the podcast episode.
