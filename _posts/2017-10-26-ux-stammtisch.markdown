Some of my [innoQ](https://innoq.com) colleagues had the idea to start a Stammtisch (German for 'regular table') about UX topics which would have a kind of 'meetup' flavor. Today was the first day that I was able to participate, and I was very glad that I could.

The topic was how to design web forms. My colleage [Roman Strangh√∂ner](https://www.innoq.com/en/staff/romans/) put together a presentation with the major dos and don'ts about designing web forms. There's so much to consider, and I found the presentation very informative and will definitely be looking back at my notes to make sure I remember everything.
