My [recent post](http://joyclark.org/sketchnote/ddd/2017/01/15/10-problems.html) about common problems in software project has gotten a lot of positive feedback.

The bad news is that I've only gotten a few pages further while reading _Domain Driven Design Distilled_ by Vaughn Vernon. 

The good news is that those pages contained more than enough information to create a new sketchnote.

What can I say?

It's a very good book, and there are a lot of sketchable things in it...
