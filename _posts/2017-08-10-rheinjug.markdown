[Marco Heimeshoff](https://twitter.com/Heimeshoff) gave an absolutely amazing talk about DDD at the rheinJUG. It was very beginner friendly (so perfect for me), and I just might have fallen in love with DDD during the talk. I also ABSOLUTELY LOVED the hand done slides! Some of the slides I just had to copy for my sketchnote. :)

As far as the actually sketchnotes go, I had fun playing with color. I got a whole bunch of new Neuland markers recently and have been trying to strategically use color. I think I will be sticking with 3 colors + 1 shadow color for the forseeable future. I like the effect.

Marco had problems with the train and was late, so [Jens Bendisposto](https://twitter.com/jbendisposto) gave a pre-RheinJUG talk about software horror stories. That was also fun to sketchnote. :)
