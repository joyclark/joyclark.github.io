One of the great things about working for [innoQ](https://innoq.com) is that we have a wide range of awesome workshops. These are great for getting an overview of the topic and to be able to discuss features and ask questions. Our Kafka workshop was absolutely amazing. The content was prepared by [Daniel Westheide](https://www.innoq.com/en/staff/daniel-westheide/), [Michael Perlin](https://twitter.com/ttzt_mp), [Philipp Neugebauer](https://twitter.com/ppneugebauer), [Niko Will](https://www.innoq.com/en/staff/niko/), and [Bj√∂rn Behrens](https://twitter.com/bjadib).
