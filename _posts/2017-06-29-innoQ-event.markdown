It was yet another great [innoQ](https://innoq.com) event! This time, we had a lot of short talks (15 and 10 minutes) and lightning talks (5 minutes). I did a lightning talk about english commas! Oxford Comma!!! The short talks were a great opportunity to practice sketchnoting!

During day two open spaces, Jan Stępień did a great session about transducers based on [this blog post](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/reducers-transducers-and-coreasync-in-clojure/). Now I finally understand them. :)

Attribution is important! I've tried to write down the twitter handle from my colleagues in the sketchnotes. If you find them interesting, check out what other interesting things they do!
