At the joint [Clojure](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Dusseldorf-Clojure-Meetup/) and [Elixir](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/preview/Elixir-Meetup-Dusseldorf) [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Dusseldorf-Clojure-Meetup/events/242644042/) in DÃ¼sseldorf, we had a round of lightning talks.

The slides for my lightning talk are here:

I also practiced graphic recording during the meetup. Here are the results:
