This week we had an internal [innoQ](https://innoq.com) workshop with [Michael Plöd](https://twitter.com/bitboss). I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a ton.
The training introduced the main concepts about DDD and we got to practice applying DDD with a case study.

Michael is also currently writing [a book](https://leanpub.com/ddd-by-example), so you should check that out.

Here are my sketchnotes. :)
