I'm never shy about admitting that Clojure is my absolute favorite language. I absolutely loved visiting the [:clojureD conference](http://clojured.de) in Berlin. It was my very first (and will definitely not be my very last) Clojure conference. It was also my first experience getting to know the larger Clojure community in Germany and Europe. I got to help with moderating the event, which was a lot of fun, and I got an opportunity to do a lot of sketchnotes. :)

I didn't get the chance to see all of the talks (it was a two track conference), but I took notes for the ones that I did talk. All of the talks are now online, so I have a lot of video to review.

'Speculative Development: Leveraging clojure.spec' from Andrew McVeigh

I've tried to write the twitter handle of the speaker (if they had one) in the Sketchnote. Attribution is very important! The [:clojureD website](http://clojured.de) also has more information about the speakers and links to the videos of the talks.
