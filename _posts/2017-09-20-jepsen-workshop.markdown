This week we had a great [Jepsen](http://jepsen.io/) workshop with [Kyle Kingsbury](https://aphyr.com/about). I really enjoyed my time and I learned a lot about Jepsen, how to test distributed key/value stores, and cats. :)

The workshop started out by covering the basics of [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). I didn't learn that much about Clojure itself (since I am already familiar with the basics), but I did learn a bit about how to explain Clojure. Kyle managed to not say the 'macro' word for a long time!

We then learned about the fundamentals of Jepsen. We spent the afternoon interactively going through the [Jepsen tutorial for writing a test](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) with help from Kyle. It was definitely an interesting experience. I also enjoyed hearing my colleages say "now I understand more why people love Clojure". :D
