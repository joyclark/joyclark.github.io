This year was the first [TopConf Düsseldorf](https://www.topconf.com/conference/duesseldorf-2017/). My overall impression of the conference was very good. The food was awesome and the conference speakers were all excellent. I'm interested to see how the conference develops in future years.

I also gave a talk at the conference called 'The Enemy of the State'. Here are [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/joyclark/the-enemy-of-the-state) from that:
