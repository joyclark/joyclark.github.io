                <p>A driven, passionate software developer who strives for perfection and
                    revels in the challenge of getting there. I love learning new skills and
                    concepts, and I love the satisfied feeling that I get whenever I have
                    written a piece of code that I consider to be simple and elegant.
                    My programming style has been greatly influenced by the functional
                    programming paradigm. I use immutable data structures and higher order
                    functions whenever it is possible.

                <p>I was born and raised in the United States of America. When I was 18
                    years
                    old, I decided to move to D端sseldorf, Germany to expand my personal
                    horizons
                    and to learn a new language. After completing a year in language school,
                    I enrolled in the University of D端sseldorf and completed my Bachelor's
                    Degree in Computer Science in 2013. In February 2016, I completed my
                    Master's Degree in Computer Science at the University of D端sseldorf.

                <p>During the course of my studies, I worked part time as a research
                    assistant
                    at the University of D端sseldorf which gave experience in all of the
                    different stages of the software development process. There I gained
                    practical experience working with the languages Java, Groovy, Prolog,
                    Clojure, and JavaScript. In March 2016, I began work as a Consultant at
                    <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/">innoQ</a>, a consulting company
                    specializing in providing custom software solutions (<a
